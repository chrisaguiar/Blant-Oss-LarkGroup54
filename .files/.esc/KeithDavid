The body of Keith David lays in front of you. He has your eyes, your hair, your face, your body. In fact, the only difference is he has a metal molar in the back of his mouth, and a large hole pierced through his heart. A billion thoughts are racing through your head as your brain attempts to understand how it is looking at your own corpse. What is going on! Who is he? Who am I?? Am I DEAD?! When a calm akin to morphine drips into your mind. What is going on. Who is he. Am I? … The questions fade away and don’t seem all that important anymore. All that’s important is I leave this ship. Yeah, that’s what I was doing. I need to use the escape pod. Nothing else matters… I’m almost free.
