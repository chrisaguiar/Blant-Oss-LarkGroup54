Lying dead in a puddle of his filth was the ever-noble Captain Tom Skerritt of Gargantua-3. Seeing the lack of obvious physical harm, the many empty bottles of hard liquor surrounding the Captain are the likely cause of his demise. It seems that despite the bravado and slight better-than-you attitude the Captain put on for as long as you can remember when the cards were on the table, the Captain chose to lock himself away and drink his way into oblivion. Perhaps you are being too harsh on him, but you can't shake the feeling of disgust.
