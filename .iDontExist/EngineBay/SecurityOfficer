Security Officer Ripley died from disembowelment. Around her body is pure carnage, as it seems her last breaths were spent defending the last functioning engine. Her electric baton is broken in two, and the jagged handle portion appears to have been used as a makeshift shank. Perhaps if she had adequate tools, you wouldnâ€™t be in this mess. The blood on the business end of the shank is probably the same as the blood leading from the engine bay to the halls. Whoever (or whatever) it was, the engine bay was not its final resting place.
