There are stacks of medical supplies locked behind the clear acrylic of the cabinet doors. A chart with an itemized list of the medical supplies hangs on the side of the cabinet. There is a bottle of rubbing alcohol on the shelf near the gurney, as well as a container of cotton balls and a handful of popsicle sticks. Every surgical tool is stowed for travel, and only the medic and captain can retrieve them.
