Exerpt from journal found in the vent below professor willard:
I know that I don’t usually write personal experiences in my research journal, but this needs to be recorded. I walked past the engine room when I overheard terrible metal banging on metal within the engine bay. As I turned to investigate, I heard Officer Ripley yell, “what the HELL are you doing!?” before a blood curling scream emanated from the room. It felt as if my blood had turned to ice, and before I could even grasp the reality of my situation, I was bolting away as fast as I could. I decided my only chance was to hide in electrical. I can’t stop shaking. I want to listen for whatever the hell is out there, but I can’t hear anything over the sound of my heartbeat. God, I hope Jake is safe; he doesn’t deserve this. Not like that coward, we call a captain! After talking all that bravado, he runs into his room and locks me out when he hears the scream! It would be a lot better behind a lock and key instead of hiding in here! Do you know what gets me the most? The officer didn’t say, “what the hell are you,” she said, “what the hell are you DOING,” as if it were a person. A person could not have made such a scream. I don’t know what’s going on, but I think there’s an imposter among us! What the HELL was on that asteroid???
