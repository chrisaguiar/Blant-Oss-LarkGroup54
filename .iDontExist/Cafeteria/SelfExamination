You have a pounding headache and feel disoriented. You know something big happened, but trying to remember hurts your head. It would appear that you've just gotten up from a fall. You look down and see that your clothes are tattered and recently bloodstained. You should probably go to Medbay and make sure you don't have any further injuries. Use "cd .." to exit the Cafeteria when you're ready.
