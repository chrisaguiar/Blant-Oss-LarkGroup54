In one of the dark corners of the room lies the remains of the head navigator, Veronica. The only way to identify her was her navigatorâ€™s sweater vest, as something powerful had pierced through the back of her skull, completely obliterating the front and back of her head. The lack of struggle signs indicates that she was not aware of the danger when it happened. The location of her corpse seems to suggest her body was moved from her original location, perhaps in an attempt to hide the body.
