Basic Commands

ls
Use ls to see what is inside of a room, or inside of an inventory. When you type ls, it is simmilar to using your eyes. You can see things around you, but you can't see through walls and desks for example. If you open the desk and then type ls, you can now see inside the desk. ls will show you many files. If it does not start with a dot and does not end with a /, it is a normal file.

cat
Use cat to see what is inside of normal files. If the file does not start with a dot (.), or end with a slash (/) you can type cat (filename) to see what is inside of it. You can learn useful information and learn things by using cat on files.

cd
Use cd to move around. ls is simmilar to using your eyes to see things, cd is simmilar to using your legs to walk around the spaceship. In combination with ls you can move effectively. If you use ls and see that there is a room called EngineRoom, then you can use cd EngineRoom to walk inside the engine room. Once in there, you can use ls once again and explore the ship. You can also use cd .. to move backwards, if you're in a room and there is nowhere else to go, you can use cd .. to move back a step. cd means move, and the .. means back 1 step. You can use cd .. multiple times to step back more times, be careful not to exit the game.

Running Scripts
If a file starts with a dot (.), you can run it, it's a script! Type ./(filename) to run it. This will allow you to learn things, pick up items, steal items, etc. 

Once you're inside the main game, type cd Cafeteria to walk to the Cafeteria and get started!
