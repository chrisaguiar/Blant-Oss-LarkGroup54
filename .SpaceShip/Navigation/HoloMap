The green HoloMap glows in the center of the room. In the center of the map is Messier 31, the black hole at the center of the andromeda galaxy. Its label incorrectly reads DEV/NULL/, which resulted from the captain pranking the head navigator. It remains DEV/NULL/ as a reminder of the event. The yellow blip that represents the Gargantua 3, has started to drift from its stable orbit around DEV/NULL/ and is now following the red prediction path into the black hole.
